# Divisibility-transformer
A program that checks if an integer is divisible by P, where P is another (fixed, small) integer. This is a transformer implementation which works well for small values of P (e.g. P=3 or P=5), and less so for large values of P. It has a scratchpad (without the scratchpad it doesn't learn the division rule).
