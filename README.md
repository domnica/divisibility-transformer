This is a program that checks if an integer is divisible by `P`, where `P` is a (fixed, small) integer. This is a transformer implementation which works well for small values of `P` (e.g. `P=3` or `P=5`), and less well for large values of `P`. The scratchpad makes a difference (without the scratchpad it doesn't learn the division rule).
