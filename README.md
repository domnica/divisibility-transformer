This is a program that checks if an integer is divisible by `P`, where `P` is a (fixed, small) integer. It is a transformer implementation and works well for small values of `P` (e.g. `P=3` or `P=5`), but less well for large values of `P`. The transformer uses a scratchpad that predicts intermediate remainders; this makes a difference (without the scratchpad it doesn't learn the division rule even for `P=3`).
